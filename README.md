This is a basic log and reflective diary for undertaking any project. It was initially just intended to be a programming journal so I could practice the SQLite module in Python, but as I was starting to put it together, I realised it would fit the "100 Days" format really well.

You do not need an IDE to run the project locally; however, if you wish to make changes to the code or inspect it locally you will. I recommend VS Code or PyCharm.

In your terminal, navigate into the project folder:

```
$ cd 100-days-log
```

Run the script in the terminal:

```
$ python3 app.py
```
